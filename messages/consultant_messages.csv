Vacccine Mandates PRO,Human,"Vaccine mandates are some of the strongest tools to fight a global pandemic. They are safe, scientifically proven to protect people and ward off deadly outbreaks of viruses now and in the future. They are also free and easy to get for most people in our country. Before vaccines are widely distributed, they go through rigorous testing to ensure that they are safe for the general population and have mostly minor side effects that go away in a few hours to a few days. Since every person is different and has different health needs and concerns, mandates are also incredibly important to making sure that vulnerable and older people are protected from viruses. If we each do our small part, we can put a halt to a global pandemic, keep our friends, families, and neighbors safe, and get back to living our lives."
Vacccine Mandates PRO,Human,"Vaccinations have proven to be effective in prohibiting and minimizing disease for you, your families and friends. From smallpox to COVID,  vaccines have made us safer and healthier. The more science learns about the spread of disease and the costs of those diseases to us in terms of our own health, the health of the world in which we live and our economy, it becomes imperative that we move forward and require life-saving vaccines for eveeryone.
Vaccines are safe, effective and were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials -- meeting the most rigorous scientific standards.
And now we learn that those who failed to simply get the COVID vaccine and then contracted COVID have long term disabilities and symptoms. This is particularly true among men who contracted COVID. According to National Geographic Magazine, men may be six times more likely to develop brief or long-term erectile dysfunction after contracting the virus.
Think about it. Vaccines can prevent this. Because they work. And, have done so for decades.
So, for your friends, your family and yourself, vaccinate. Everyone."
Vacccine Mandates PRO,Human,"Influenza – just the standard flu – kills, on average, 400,000 per year. It’s a rapidly spreading virus that has the potential to kill millions annually, but herd immunity keeps the number of deaths low. 

Herd immunity, or when a high percentage of any population is vaccinated, drastically reduces the chance that that disease can be spread. If one person is surrounded by fifty people that are vaccinated, the chance that the disease will be passed to someone else is minimal, and the disease will likely disappear again. 

Every year, millions of US citizens receive the flu vaccine. But there’s still flu deaths because not everyone gets vaccinated – the United States could essentially eradicate flu deaths by imposing vaccine mandates, and require that most of the population does its part to prevent the spread of disease. 

Vaccine mandates make herd immunity possible. Vaccine mandates would drastically reduce deaths of various spreadable diseases. Vaccine mandates would protect the most vulnerable populations. It prevents long term and lasting conditions as a result of disease. Vaccine mandates are good for the greater society, at little to no risk to those required to receive vaccinations – so creating vaccine mandates is the best possible way to protect populations from disease.

Vacccine Mandates AGAINST,Human,"Vaccine mandates are a scattershot way to fight a global pandemic. There is simply no ""one size fits all"" approach to dealing with a global pandemic. Every country is different and every company that manufactures vaccines does it in a different way with questionable government oversight. It seems like politicians are always in a hurry to get something their way and they cut corners to get vaccines out the door. There have also been reports of some vaccines not being fully formulated and there have been horrible cases where innocent people have had awful side effects to the shots, including death! I simply don't think the government should be telling us what to do with our bodies. There are so many unknowns as it relates to Covid and the various strains -- I find it hard to believe that vaccines created here and there by different companies can really keep up the healthcare needs of people around the world. It also feels like a waste of money that could go to helping people in their daily lives with food, housing, and access to normal medical care."
Vacccine Mandates AGAINST,Human,"The government should not be telling us what to put into our body. And it certainly shouldn’t force us.  It is our freedom and fundamental rights that are at risk when the government mandates vaccinations. We must stand up to big government bureaucrats and giant pharmaceutical companies who tell us how we should take care of our own bodies and own health for their own financial gain. Too often the doctors and scientist have been wrong about vaccines with tragic consequences: permanent disabilities, children with autism, and even death caused by vaccinations. Moreover, they don’t work. There are countless examples of folks who have been vaccinated and still died from the disease they sought to prevent. And if that’s not proof enough, there are multiple stories of people experiencing horrendous side effects and even falling deathly ill from a vaccine.  These risks are totally unnecessary. 
Vaccines don’t work. They take away our most basic freedoms.  It is  time to say no to vaccinations."
Vacccine Mandates AGAINST,Human,"Vaccine mandates are not a good response to global pandemics because the vaccine could cause long-term health outcomes potentially worse than the virus itself, the vaccine will create a vaccine-resistant strain—also potentially worse than the original virus—and there are other effective means of preventing the spread of a pandemic. First, in an emergency situation such as a global pandemic, vaccines will need to be developed in a shockingly short period of time in order to be useful; however, this does not leave adequate time for trials, especially trials that test for long-term health problems created by the vaccine, health problems which could be worse than the virus itself. Second, a vaccine will likely create a vaccine-resistant strain of the virus, which could be more deadly than the virus itself. Third and finally, there are other methods to contain the spread of a global pandemic. For example, many countries in Asia, especially China, contained the spread of COVID-19 for over a year while the rest of the world struggled to do so, using a combination of testing, lockdowns, mask mandates, and bans against foreigners from coming into the country.

Rigged Elections PRO,Human,"The U.S. has some of the worst election systems in the world. Every state has different rules on how you can vote, when you can vote, who can vote, and where you can vote. It's a disaster. In some instances, even counties in the U.S. have different rules in the same state! There are no federal guidelines to make the system fair and balanced across the board. People can ""vote early"" now, but I am very skeptical on where those votes and ballots are stored after someone votes early. People can also ""vote by mail"" in the run-up to Election Day, which also freaks me out. I've heard so many stories that political people collect the mail and hold onto the materials until they need them. Election Day in America is now an utter mess and hardly any races are called on time anymore because of all the ballots flying around. In this day and age, I just don't trust local government people -- people who are involved in this whole thing because of party politics -- to count votes fairly. Since political people are so involved in how we vote and how we count votes, I think our elections will forever be rigged. There needs to be an independent system to restore trust and accountability in the U.S. Plus, the Electoral College is a disaster!"
Rigged Elections PRO,Human,"In an age of technology where computers can be hacked remotely, wireless devices can be smaller than a grain of rice, and public officials rely on complex voting machines to count up the votes and tell us which candidate won, how can we possibly trust our elections? Every time we cast our ballots, we choose the people who will control millions or even billions of taxpayer dollars, and that’s all the incentive greedy corporations, dirty politicians and even foreign governments need to use to rig these high-tech voting machines to deliver exactly the results they want. So few Americans vote, even among those who are registered, bad actors have all the extra names and addresses they need to feed phantom votes into the election software and produce results that still look convincing. In the end, voters and possibly even some election officials won’t know that the winning candidates were selected, not elected."
Rigged Elections PRO,Human,"It is a reality that both Republicans and Democrats in America act in the interest of self-preservation. This leads to different rules of voting in each state. These rules favor the ruling political party by either increasing access to the ballot for voters who are more likely to vote for the ruling political party, or by creating more red tape for voters who are more likely to vote against the ruling political party. The very fact that voters in America are playing by two different rules designed to favor either party is itself evidence of rigged elections. Moreover, both Democrats and Republicans redraw election districts to favor electoral outcomes for their party. It is clear that the game of electoral politics is all about rigging outcomes to better favor whichever party has a majority at the time—to think otherwise is naive."
Rigged Election AGAINST,Human,"The United States has some of the most secure elections anywhere in the world. At every level of the U.S. election system from the federal level to the local level, there are checks and balances to ensure that every vote counts. Election administrators are true defenders of American democracy and they have done incredible work over the last few decades to protect the integrity of our elections in an era of rapid technological change. These advancements have expanded access to the ballot for millions of people and participation across the board is going up in the U.S. People can vote from the comfort of their own homes, they can mail in a ballot, they can vote early in person, and they can vote on Election Day near their home or their workplace. Once someone has casted their ballot, bipartisan protections are in place to help the administrators in their work. Every ballot that is reviewed is looked at by a Republican and a Democrat to ensure its validity. From the neighborhood level to the Electoral College to elect a president, the U.S. election system is strong. It was truly tested in January 2021 and held up. That's all you need to know. "
Rigged Election AGAINST,Human,"American elections are fair. They’re run by competent people whose only goal is accurately counting every voters’ ballot. We know this because the United States doesn’t hold one national election, or even 50 state elections, but rather thousands of local elections, big and small, all across the country. Each one is run by local clerks accountable to their own communities. Even the smallest rural counties still need a handful of staff to tabulate collect ballots and tabulate vote totals. The bigger the county, the more oversight and scrutiny on the clerk and election staff to administer a fair election. These people are watched by volunteers from the political parties, who observe the counting process, all looking for evidence of cheating. Which brings us to the simple fact of human nature that lets us know our elections are secure- people don’t keep secrets very well. If there were widespread “rigging,” across the ten thousand plus municipal elections in 2020 or any recent year, someone would have spilled the beans by now. There are simply too many elections involving too many people for any scheme to “rig” the overall results of a state or the country to succeed in secrecy."
Rigged Election AGAINST,Human,"When American leaders spread erroneous claims of rigged elections, it erodes relationships between neighbors, friends, and family, sews distrust in our system of government, and ultimately makes Americans less free. Following the 2020 Presidential Election, peddlers of rigged election conspiracy theories brought countless cases into courtrooms across the country in a misguided and potentially malicious, attempt to prove voter fraud swayed the election. In not one of those court cases were any instances of voter fraud discovered. This led those same conspiracy theorists to attack the courts and the rule of law by taking advantage of their supporters’ faith and manipulating them into distrusting the legal system. A community cannot remain united when neighbors are being fed two alternative realities. The question of whether elections are rigged is simple to answer: no. Out of 24 million ballots only 400 potential instances of voter fraud were found. For the sake of America’s future, we must unite around that simple truth."
Deportations PRO,Human,"The consequences of illegal immigration are far-reaching and allowing people to illegally remain in America means our system of government is threatened and our laws are meaningless.  
Illegal immigration causes an enormous drain on public funds. Accommodating the needs of endless numbers of poor, unskilled illegal entrants undermines the quality of education, healthcare and other services for Americans.
Illegal immigration overwhelms communities by crowding classrooms, consuming already limited affordable housing, and increasing the strain on precious natural resources.
Illegal Immigration compromises our nation’s security, allowing potential terrorists to hide in the same shadows.
.If you’re in America illegally you should immediately be prosecuted and removed.  We don’t allow God-fearing, honorable, patriotic Americans who ran afoul of the law to roam our streets freely so it makes no sense that we allow foreigners to remain. Get them out of our country, build a fence and let’s finally protect our children and our culture from these criminals.  
"
Deportations PRO,Human,"There's a misconception that I hear a lot from people out on the campaign trail. They tell me that just because I don't support illegal immigration, that I'm heartless, immoral, a bad person. 

They couldn't be farther from the truth. I support deportation of illegal immigrants because my morality demands it. 

It isn't right to let people in this country just to treat them like dirt. Illegal immigrants can't send their children to good schools, they can't access social services if they need them, they can't stand up to an abusive boss or partner without being threatened with deportation, and they're forced to live a life in the shadows, unprotected by the laws of this country. They're cut off from their families, susceptible to financial abuse, and they can't even go to a hospital. Nobody in America should be living like that.

People deserve the chance for a good life, and letting a stream of illegal immigrants into America doesn't help anyone. 

It might not ""sound nice,"" but I'm not here to ""sound nice."" I'm here to tell the truth and do what's right. And the truth is, it's better for everyone if people who are here illegally go home. Legal immigration alone is the only way to keep us safe, and keep them safe. If we let people stay in this country illegally, we can't protect them. 

Deportations might sound harsh, but it's the better alternative. None of us should be forced to live a life in the shadows. "
Deportations PRO,Human,"For a country to effectively maintain law and order and protect its citizens, it must enforce its laws. When immigrants come to the US illegally, they should not be able to stay, and therefore, deportations are a good solution to expel current illegal immigrants and deter future illegal immigration. In the US, there are opportunities for people to apply to come to the US via legal pathways that don’t require them to break the law. These legal pathways exist to vet the immigrants and ensure they will be safe, prosperous members of society. When illegal immigration occurs, our nation is put in harm's way since we do not know if these people are dangerous. Additionally, it is unsafe to get to the US illegally. Migrants pay to be smuggled over the southern border, a process that leads to countless, unaccounted-for deaths and family separations. As a nation, we should do everything we can to disincentivize people to break the law and enter the US illegally. If migrants know that they will be deported if they are discovered in the US illegally, they will be less likely to embark on the dangerous migration journey and take such an immense risk."
Deportations AGAINST,Human,"America is a melting pot of ethnicities.  A gumbo of people who all bring their own spice and experiences to a land that once only held Native Americans.  This rich cultural mixture of immigrants has created the richest and most powerful country in history.
These people seeking a better life for their children walk a thousand miles through gang infested jungles in the hope of securing a low wage job in America so that their children can conceivably live the glorious American dream
If the twelve million undocumented immigrants were deported there would be few restaurant meals prepared, lawns mowed, homes cleaned.  These industrious people literally make America work and have for generations.
Research proves that undocumented immigrants increase the size of the U.S. economy, contribute to economic growth, contribute more in taxes than they collect, reduce firms incentives to offshore jobs and benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services.
The message to those who came here is simple – welcome to your new home."
Deportations AGAINST,Human,"100 years ago, my grandmother immigrated to the United States from Ukraine. By herself, with two children in tow, she made her way across Europe, across the Atlantic Ocean, and to Ellis Island. She knew that coming to America would mean a better life for her and her family. Today, her grandchildren are doctors, lawyers, and teachers, all because she believed in the American Dream. 

If my grandmother came to the United States today, her children would have been taken from her at the border and thrown into cages. To get them back, she would have to navigate a legal system in a language she didn't know. If by some miracle she made it to America, she would live in constant fear of deportation. She would spend every day looking over her shoulder. And if she was sent back to Ukraine, she would have turned right back around and tried again. 

It could've been us. 

We can't keep letting this happen. If the [Republicans, or other group here] get what they want, America won't be a beacon of hope and opportunity. It'll be a wall of barbed wire. 

In honor of my grandmother's sacrifices, I've made it my mission to help people like her make their way to a better life. 

Will you join me in my mission? 

Let's do it together, for every parent who fights for a better life for their children.

Deportations AGAINST,Human,"Deportations are not a good solution to illegal immigration in the US. Immigrants in the US illegally are less likely to commit crimes since they know that interactions with law enforcement could lead to them being sent back to their home country — often nations they fled from because of violence, persecution, or general unrest. Deporting these immigrants who are not committing crimes means putting them back into harm’s way, which is an entirely inhumane way to operate as a nation. Immigrants who live in the US illegally typically work jobs that American citizens are less likely to want to do, like picking berries in the hot sun or working at factories with terrible hours and rough conditions. We rely on the labor of these immigrants to feed and power our country. If deportations become the norm in the US, we will lose current contributors to our economy and fewer people will take the risk to come to the US — we will lose this workforce that we have come to rely on. For these economic considerations and for the issue of humanity and care for our fellow humans, deportations are not a good solution to illegal immigration in the US."
